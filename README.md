# Analysis of Sociological Data - Portfolio

This portfolio examines income inequality, labor, education, and gender using OECD and Eurostat data. It also explores the question, “To what extent is the amount spent on social protections indicative of economic equality?”. OECD datasets were merged and cleaned on Stata in order to analyze correlations and causality between social expenditure and the following independent variables: poverty gap, Gini coefficient for income inequality, and gender wage gap.
